<p>Biceps</p>
<ul> 
    <li>Barbell Curl: Stand with feet shoulder-width apart, grip a barbell with an underhand grip, and curl the weight upwards while keeping your elbows close to your body. Lower the weight back down with control.</li>
    <li>Dumbbell Curl: Similar to the barbell curl but using dumbbells instead. This allows for a greater range of motion and can help prevent muscle imbalances.</li>
    <li>Hammer Curl: Hold a pair of dumbbells with a neutral grip (palms facing each other) and curl the weights towards your shoulders.</li>
</ul>
<p>triceps</p>
<ul>
    <li>Tricep Dips: Using parallel bars or a sturdy bench, lower your body by bending your elbows until your arms are at a 90-degree angle, then push back up to the starting position.</li>
    <li>Tricep Pushdown: Attach a rope or straight bar to a high pulley cable machine, grasp the attachment with an overhand grip, and push the attachment downwards until your arms are fully extended.</li>
    <li>Close-Grip Bench Press: Grip the barbell with your hands closer together than shoulder-width apart and perform a bench press, focusing on engaging your triceps.</li>
</ul>
